# nihongo.space

nihongo.space is a website to start learning simple words in japanese (such as colors, part of the body, animal names etc...) with your friends.
It is recommended to learn all [kana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana) before starting to practice but it is not required as [rōmaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese) can also be enabled in the `Game options` settings of nihongo.space.

As stated above this form of Japanese learning is most useful for learning simple words since most words in Japanese have multiple meanings, but there is only one "right" answer per word on nihongo.space.

## How to play

- Create a room or join someone's room.
- After joining the room a list of players in the room with their scores is shown on the left.
- The game is to guess the Japanese words shown in the middle of the screen, write the answer in the chatbox when you guessed it. The word pool can be changed in the option menu
- After 30 rounds the game is over and the winner is the one with the highest score.
- ???
- Get better at Japanese (maybe)

## Adding custom words

You can add custom words by inputting them in the `Choose Wordpool`, one by line using the format: `kana;kanji;romaji;english`

Example:

いち;一;ichi;english
